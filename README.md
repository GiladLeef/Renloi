## Hello, World!
Without using a function

```py
print("Hello, World")
```
Using a function:

```py
def helloworld():
    print("Hello, World")

def main():
    helloworld() 
```


As you can see from the code example above, your program starts executing in the main() function.

Note: All the functions you want to include inside the main function, needs to be written above the main function.

If you didn't declare any function, you don't need to use the main() function.
